# Holiday.py
This project uses Python to calculate a userâ€™s total holiday cost, including their plane, hotel, and car rental costs. I take in user inputs detailing 
which city they are flying to, the number of nights spent and number of days they will be renting a car for. 
Functions have been created to take 
an argument and return a total cost for flights, hotel and car rental, all three functions are called and finally a total cost for the holiday is printed 
alongside details provided about the holiday in a readable way.
